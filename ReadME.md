## Description

Project Website for Horiseon Marketing.

The main priority when rewriting the code for this website was changing all of the <div> tags/elements to semantic tags/elements to make it more accessible to users or browsers with translation tools, or assistive technologies such as screen readers. Another reason I used semantic elements is to allow the computer to read the website better and allow a higher search engine ranking to be available to users globally. Some minor change weas also made on the <nav> bar to allow it to function correctly.
